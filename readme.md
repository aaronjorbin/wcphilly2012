*   # On a cold dark night...

*   # The headless browser is REAL

*   # The headless browser is ALIVE

*   # The headless browser is HERE TODAY

*   # It's name is PHANTOMJS

*   # And it is as powerful as you fear

*   # Let's look at some things we can do:

*   # [Unit Tests](http://2011.sf.wordcamp.org/session/javascript-unit-testing/)

*   # [Integration Testing](http://tech.priviahealth.com/casperjs-for-testing/)

*   # Other Testing Tools

*   # Scraping

*   # Build Tools

*   # Let's look at what these really mean

*   # Fire Bugs, not Big Bird

*   # You Didn't Build That

*   # Malarkey : Irish for you didn't test your code

*   # My code looks like a bean 

*   # Unit Testing is GLORIOUS

*   # [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) Can run our test for us automagically

*   # [Test Frameworks](https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs/wiki/Headless-Testing)

*   # Integration Testing

*   # [CasperJS](http://casperjs.org/)

*   # Verify your functionality works

*   # PRO: Uses real data

*   # CON: Uses real data

*   # MOAR TESTING

*   # &lt;psa&gt;

*   # There is such a thing as too much testing

*   # &lt;/psa&gt;

*   # Performance Testing

*   # Fastest Resource

*   # Slowest Resource

*   # Smallest Resource

*   # Largest Resource

*   # Scraping 

*   # [pjscrape](https://github.com/nrabinowitz/pjscrape)

*   # What does the DOM say? 

*   # Build Tools

*   # If you don't have a build script, you're doing_it_wrong()&trade;

*   # Build Scripts are great, you should have binders filled with them

*   # SVG & Canvas to png

*   # Screen Shots of your theme

*   # Appcache manifest

*   # Never worry about your theme's screen shots being out of date

*   # Now What?
