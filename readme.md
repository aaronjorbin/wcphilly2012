*   # On a cold dark night...
<!-- On a cold dark night along the banks of the deloware river, back in the days when DHTML was in flavor and MySpace ruled our social life, a band of brave developers rode there steeds with vigor with the dream of application that asyncronously request files coded in an extensibe way.  They spoke of analyzing the real performance of sites in a manner that required no clicks of a mouse.  Throught the fog in front of them they saw letters they could barely make out. K. H. T. M. L. thse letter were powerd the mysterius forces of the LGPL.  What could this obscure open source project give rise to? As they drew closer they saw the letter the fork.  And then fork again.  Soon, so many branches interwieving that it appeared as though the browser it self was headles.  A Browser without a windowing system? This was too scary of an idea for these developers.  Forced to turn back, they came to speak of this headless browser.  The legend grew.  Afraid of what this could bring.  Of the power a headless browser could yield, the developers didn't speak of it except in mermebs.  For the first time publically, I will tell you what really happend that night.  I'll share the truth behind the legend of the headless browser -->  

*   # The headless browser is REAL

*   # The headless browser is ALIVE

*   # The headless browser is HERE TODAY

*   # it's name is PHANTOMJS

*   # And it is as powerfull as you fear

*   # Let's look at some things we can do:

*   # [Unit Tests](http://2011.sf.wordcamp.org/session/javascript-unit-testing/)

*   # [Integration Testing](http://tech.priviahealth.com/casperjs-for-testing/)

*   # Other Testing Tools

*   # Scraping

*   # Build Tools

*   # Let's look at what these really mean

*   # Fire Bugs, not Big Bird

*   # You Didn't Build That

*   # Unit Testing is GLORIUS

*   # [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) Can run our test for us automagically

*   # [Test Frameworks](https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs/wiki/Headless-Testing)

*   # Integration Testing

*   # [CasperJS](http://casperjs.org/)

*   # Verify your functionality works

*   # PRO: Uses real data

*   # CON: Uses real data

*   # MOAR TESTING

*   # &lt;psa&gt;

*   # There is such a thing as too much testing

*   # &lt;/psa&gt;

*   # Performance Testing
